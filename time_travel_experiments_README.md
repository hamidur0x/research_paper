## 🪞 1. Time Mirrors — Reversing Time Signals

- **Researchers at CUNY** developed metamaterials that act like **time mirrors** by reversing electromagnetic waves.  
- [Physicists confirm time mirrors are real in wild study (New York Post, 2025)](https://nypost.com/2025/05/22/science/physicists-confirm-time-mirrors-are-real-in-wild-study/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- These mirrors manipulate wavefronts to appear as though they bounce *back in time*.
- Potential applications include signal processing, radar, and advanced imaging.

## 🧠 2. Quantum Simulations of Time Travel

- **Cambridge University** simulated **Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)** using entangled quantum particles.  
- Quantum sensors were shown to "retroactively" improve measurements based on future outcomes.
- Reported by: [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/10/231005101623.htm)

## 🔁 3. Reversible Quantum Systems

- Studies in **Phys.org (2025)** and **Scientific Reports** confirm that time symmetry can exist in quantum systems.
- These systems show that **two arrows of time** may emerge under certain environmental conditions.
- Memory kernel models indicate partial reversibility in quantum evolution.

## 🔄 4. Quantum Entanglement Across Time

- Entanglement may allow particles to influence each other across time—not just space.
- [Interesting Engineering – Quantum Entanglement Across Time](https://interestingengineering.com/science/quantum-entanglement-time-physicists)
- This could imply that future measurements can affect past quantum states.

## ⚙️ 5. Experimental Proposals: Time Travel Devices

- Physicist **Ronald Mallett** proposed a ring laser system to generate CTCs using gravitational frame dragging.
- [Phys.org article on Mallett’s proposal](https://phys.org/news/2020-01-black-hole-physicist-theory-time.html)
- Still theoretical and unverified, but grounded in General Relativity.
