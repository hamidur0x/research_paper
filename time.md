# ⏳ Time Travel — Full Research Overview

This document presents a complete, science-backed research summary on **time travel**, including theories, experiments, paradoxes, and expert viewpoints.

## 📌 1. What is Time Travel?

### 🔹 Time Dilation (Forward Travel)
- Based on **Einstein's Special Relativity**: time slows for objects moving near light speed.
- Verified by atomic clocks on GPS satellites and jets.
- ✅ Proven in real-world physics.

### 🔹 Gravitational Time Dilation
- According to **General Relativity**, time passes slower in strong gravitational fields (e.g., near black holes).
- Also experimentally confirmed.

## 📌 2. Theoretical Models for Traveling Backward in Time

### 🔹 Wormholes (Einstein–Rosen Bridges)
- Hypothetical shortcuts through spacetime that could connect distant points — and potentially different times.
- Require *exotic matter* with negative energy density.

### 🔹 Tipler Cylinder
- A massive, rotating cylinder could bend spacetime into a loop.
- Mathematically valid but physically impossible (requires infinite length).

### 🔹 Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)
- Spacetime geometries that loop back on themselves.
- Suggested by Gödel, Tipler, and others.

## 📌 3. Time Travel Paradoxes & Resolutions

### 🔹 Grandfather Paradox
> What happens if you travel back and prevent your own birth?

### 🔹 Solutions
- **Novikov Self-Consistency Principle**: Events must remain consistent — paradoxes are impossible.
- **Multiverse Theory**: Every change spawns a new timeline, avoiding contradictions.
- **Chronology Protection Conjecture** (Stephen Hawking): Laws of physics prevent time loops.
- **Paradox-Free CTC Models**: [University of Queensland Research](https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-solve-time-travel-paradox)
