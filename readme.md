echo "${YELLOW}# ⏳ Time Travel — Full Research Overview${NC}"
echo ""
echo "This document presents a complete, science-backed research summary on time travel, including theories, experiments, paradoxes, and expert viewpoints."

# Section 1
echo "${CYAN}## 📌 1. What is Time Travel?${NC}"
echo ""
echo "### 🔹 Time Dilation (Forward Travel)"
echo "- Based on Einstein's Special Relativity: time slows at near-light speed."
echo "- Verified by atomic clocks on GPS satellites."
echo "- ✅ Proven in real physics."
echo ""
echo "### 🔹 Gravitational Time Dilation"
echo "- Time passes slower near massive bodies like black holes."
echo "- Confirmed by General Relativity."

# Section 2
echo ""
echo "${CYAN}## 📌 2. Theoretical Models for Traveling Backward in Time${NC}"
echo ""
echo "### 🔹 Wormholes (Einstein–Rosen Bridges)"
echo "- Hypothetical spacetime shortcuts that could connect points in time."
echo "- Requires exotic matter with negative energy."
echo ""
echo "### 🔹 Tipler Cylinder"
echo "- A rotating, infinite cylinder might curve spacetime into loops."
echo "- Mathematically sound but physically impossible."
echo ""
echo "### 🔹 Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)"
echo "- Time loops allowed by certain solutions in General Relativity."

# Section 3
echo ""
echo "${CYAN}## 📌 3. Time Travel Paradoxes & Resolutions${NC}"
echo ""
echo "### 🔹 Grandfather Paradox"
echo "> What happens if you go back in time and prevent your own birth?"
echo ""
echo "### 🔹 Solutions"
echo "- **Novikov Principle**: Events must remain consistent (no paradoxes)."
echo "- **Multiverse Theory**: Changes create alternate timelines."
echo "- **Chronology Protection Conjecture** (Hawking): Physics prevents paradoxes."
echo "- **UQ Model**: [Paradox-Free CTCs](https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-solve-time-travel-paradox)"
